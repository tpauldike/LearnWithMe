# LearnWithMe
**LearnWithMe** is a web app that started as a form designed to have the users subscribe for classes on `HTML & CSS`, `JavaScript`, `React`, `C` or `Python`.

Here is what it looked like in the browser, in the light theme mode:

And here is what it looks like in the dark theme mode of the web browser:

It is a simple web app that makes it easier for one to practice building an app from start to finish. It's purpose is very obvious and it is user friendly.

## Technologies
The technologies used so far are `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` as the backend is yet to be implemented
